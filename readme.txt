Uses CSS and Javascript to collapse children on Pages and Categories or any Unordered List that uses the css class 'children'.

== Description ==
This plugin installs some javascript in the footer of every page. Javascript detects any list items with a class of 'children'. It hides the children in the tree and sets a click event that will expand or re-collapse them. The action uses only css and javascript and occurs after your page loads, so that search engines will see the whole tree before it is collapsed.

Wordpress uses the 'children' css class when it displays pages and categories in unordered lists, but you can put anything in an unordered list with a css class of 'children' on the child UL tags and the javascript will collapse or expand it for you. 

Note: The plugin will not work with themes and widgets that overwrite the default behavior of WordPress.

There are no configurations options. The plugin is on when it is installed and enabled. To turn it off just disable the plugin from the plugin menu.
